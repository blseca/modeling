        <h2>BLSMUN III</h2>
        <p>
        Our Secretariat is dedicated to providing an educational, engaging, and affordable experience for Model UN delegates of all skill levels.
        We will be providing five committees, listed below. <strong>Boston Latin School Model United Nations is excited to be offering a novice committee this year, 
            in addition to four other committees. </strong> The committee will be guided, at a slower pace, and heavily staffed in order to teach beginners and/or those completely new
        to Model United Nations. We strive to produce an inclusive environment for delegates at all stages of their Model United Nations journey 
        and are extremely excited to work with both new and experienced delegates. 
        </p>
